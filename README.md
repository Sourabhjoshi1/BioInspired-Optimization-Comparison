# Comparative Study of Bio-Inspired Optimization Algorithms

## üöÄ Overview

This repository contains the source code and results for a comprehensive **comparative study of various bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms** (e.g., Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithms (GA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), etc.) when applied to a set of **standard benchmark mathematical functions**.

The primary goal of this work is to **evaluate the performance** of these optimizers based on key metrics such as convergence speed, solution quality (minimum objective function value), and robustness (consistency across multiple runs).

## üéØ Benchmark Functions

The algorithms are tested against a diverse set of well-known unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions to assess their **exploitation** and **exploration** capabilities.

| Function | Type | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Function Name 1]** | [Unimodal/Multimodal] | [e.g., Simple, steep gradient, single minimum] |
| **[Function Name 2]** | [Unimodal/Multimodal] | [e.g., Highly multimodal, many local minima] |
| **[Function Name 3]** | [Unimodal/Multimodal] | [e.g., Deceptive, non-separable] |
| *...and any others you have used.* | | |
